YouTube is the second most frequently visited website on the internet. YouTube hosts videos for entertainment, education, news, product advertisement and other categories, and it generates revenue for itself from advertisements and for content creators. At the same time, YouTube does not publish data analytics on its site to inform content creators or users of the site about the usage of the site, including either users’ views or creators’ uploads. The objective of this proposal is to use data mined from YouTube to create visualizations of current 2023 YouTube data and to perform statistical analyses of that data to create a paper and a web application that will inform interested individuals, companies, or researchers about the usage of the YouTube site.

The objective of this proposal is to take an existing dataset from 2023 that has been mined from the YouTube site and to use the R programming language to utilize that dataset to create visualizations of that data and to perform statistical analyses of that data. This project will create a paper that will inform interested individuals, companies, or researchers about the usage of the YouTube site. The objective of the proposal also includes the creation of a web based application for users to create visualizations of interest to them.
